    <h1>Philosophy: Truth, goodness and beauty in building software</h1>
    <q>Truth, goodness, and beauty are cosmic values that communicate divine
      meaning to the intellectual, moral, and aesthetic capacities of the human
      soul, which brings a balance in the soul, which, in turn, harmonizes the
      human person with divine meaning and purpose of the cosmos, which was
      considered the prerequisite to human flourishing. - <b>Steve Turley</b></q>

      It is usually uncommon to marry philosophy and engineering. At least it
      was for me. In the school system I took part in, we hardly ever mixed
      those diametrically opposite fields. Thus, I grew up believing that by
      becoming a software engineer, I wouldn't have to deal with those pesky
      social sciences that I was quite apathetic about back then. My perception
      was that by choosing the technical side, you get rid of the other, social
      one, and you won't have to mind it ever again in your life. I grew up
      understanding that this is increasingly being proven wrong with a
      phenomenon that occurs so often we hardly ever question it anymore,
      technological dependency.

      In the last few decades, the world is facing a transition where computers
      and software have become the very fabric of our society. We who build it
      have to become very conscious of what we do. What is the reason behind it?
      How ethical is it? Is it in the best interest of everyone involved? The
      ever-growing presence of technology in our everyday lives and the
      exponential growth of dependence on it begs a philosophical debate within
      ourselves about meaning, fusing the seemingly dissonant technical and
      social fields.
